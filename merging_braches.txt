# how to make a merge

git merge <other-branch>
    => this will mouve the actual brach to point on the <other-branch>

undo a merge
    => git reset --hard HEAD^

# Fast-forward merge

the branch being merged in must be ahead of the checked out branch.
The checked out branch's pointer will just be moved forward,
to point to the same commit as the other branch.

# the regular type of merge

two divergent branches are combined.
a merge commit is created.
